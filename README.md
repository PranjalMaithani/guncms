CMS based project using Sanity CMS and NextJS

* All content is fetched from the CMS and pages are pre-rendered for each item and tag.

* Preview mode can be toggled from an api route with a password. Realtime changes to the data are reflected on the page then, without actually publishing content to the real website.

* Webhook takes care of deploying changes to the website whenever any change is published on the CMS.

* Content can be filtered by category tags.

* Low size images are fetched for the main page and tags page. The full size image being only served on the individual item page.
